The previous AI engineer meticulously developed the AI Admission Test application through several significant iterations. Starting with core features like RAG-based question generation, Supabase integration, and hCaptcha, the work evolved based on user feedback and evolving requirements. Key phases involved resolving git secret issues, integrating password strength UI, and a substantial migration from Supabase/custom JWT authentication to Firebase Authentication. The engineer systematically addressed critical bugs related to hCaptcha verification, login/registration navigation, Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) by shifting operations to backend APIs, refining test timeout and pass/fail logic, and enhancing the dynamic display of test level statuses. The trajectory concluded with the initiation of a user profile page and associated backend functionality for phone number updates, aligning with the user's latest request for personal detail management and password reset features.

<product_requirements>
The AI-powered admission test application dynamically generates and evaluates physics questions using Gemini AI and a RAG system.
**Key functional requirements include:**
-   **Authentication:** Firebase (Email/Password) for user registration/login, replacing prior Supabase and custom JWT solutions. This includes a Profile page for viewing/editing personal details (e.g., phone number) and changing passwords, alongside a Forgot Password flow on the login page leading to the same password reset mechanism.
-   **Test Flow:** Multi-level (easy, medium, hard) with distinct timers, multi-question navigation, and per-question answer submission.
-   **Results:** Detailed evaluation (score out of 10, average of 6 criteria), refined pass/fail logic (5.0 threshold), and dynamic result display after test completion. Timeout handling ensures fair pass/fail based on score.
-   **UI/UX:** Dark mode, logout functionality, password strength feedback on registration, password visibility toggle on login, age auto-calculation, and dynamic display of level statuses (completed, locked, start test).
-   **Backend:** Supabase PostgreSQL for data storage (after migrating from MongoDB) and a robust FastAPI backend managing AI, RAG, and custom data operations (e.g., test result creation, question saving).
-   **Security:** Ensure secure handling of credentials and clean git history.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Firebase Authentication:** Primary authentication and user management.
-   **FastAPI:** Python web framework for the backend.
-   **React/Vite:** Frontend framework with fast build tools.
-   **Gemini AI:** Google's LLM for dynamic question generation and answer evaluation.
-   **LangGraph/LangChain:** Frameworks for building LLM applications and RAG.
-   **ChromaDB:** Vector database for RAG context storage.
-   **Supabase:** Backend-as-a-Service for PostgreSQL database.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for UI development.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Complete Profile Page:** Implement display for personal details, full edit functionality for phone number, and the Change Password feature.
-   **Forgot Password:** Implement Forgot Password functionality on the Login page, linking to the password reset flow.
-   **Database Update for Profile Edits:** Ensure all profile edits (e.g., phone number) are correctly persisted in the Supabase database.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing the **Profile Page** and related functionalities.
1.  **Backend Endpoint:** A new FastAPI endpoint () was added to  to allow authenticated users to update their phone numbers in the database.
2.  **Frontend Profile Page:** A new React component, , was created as a placeholder for the user's profile details.
3.  **Frontend Routing:** A new route  was added to  to enable navigation to the profile page.
4.  **Navigation Link:** A Profile button was integrated into the  page, positioned alongside the Logout button, allowing users to access their profile.

This work is partially completed. The user explicitly requested to verify the changes manually, meaning these newly added features (Profile page, phone update endpoint, password change/reset integration) are **implemented but untested** by the AI engineer. The Change password feature within the Profile page and the Forgot password flow from the Login page are conceptual and not yet implemented in code beyond the skeletal profile page.
